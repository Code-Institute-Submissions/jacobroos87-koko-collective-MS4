# User Testing

### My Mentor (Dick Vlaanderen)

On testing the site my mentor made suggestions to improve the contrast of the site.  This was done by swapping some white colour codes for black and vice versa to ensure the most readable choice was chosen.

My mentor also noticed the Edit Product template didn't have any thumbnail images which was then implemented after our last call on 04/08/21.
