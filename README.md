# KOKO Collective
## Milestone Project 4 by Jacob Roos

A live version of the website is available [here.]()

Koko Collective is a pet accessories brand selling Dog Collars, Leads, Bandanas and Waste Bag Dispensers.  The business is focussed around using recycled materials and ethical production processes.  The site allows users to purchase items, register and create their own account with order history and delivery address information.  Once a user is logged in they can review products and also add items to a wishlist which can then be transferred to their shopping bag. Admin users have access to "Product Management" which allows the addition of new products and once in the product detail section, these items can be edited or deleted.  The site is very colourful with intuitive navigation and informative feedback via notifications to ensure the best user experience.
